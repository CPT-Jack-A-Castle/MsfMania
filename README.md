# PRO/Custom version
## Informations
Recently I noticed that my tool, MsfMania, has started to become popular and is being shared on skid forums. This was to be expected.
So I know that the tool that is currently FUD, will not remain so forever. 
And that trying to make updates because people send it to VirusTotal will not be useful.

So I decided to create the PRO version of MsfMania. Which not only contains a tool to make msfvenom payloads undetectable. 
I plan to make this tool a real cyber weapon dedicated to Red-Teaming.
