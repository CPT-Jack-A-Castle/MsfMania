# PRO version
## Informations
The PRO version of MsfMania is under active development. 
It is dedicated to freelance pentesters or corporate red-teamers but students can also acquire it.

Why buy the PRO version? Well, the community version was FUD in March but quickly became unusable due to the number of downloads on VirusTotal...
The PRO version is often updated and has a customer service. 
The community version will never be updated again and the version still has several years of existence in the future.
